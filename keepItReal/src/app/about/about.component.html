<h2>Therapy is such a taboo in the black community. There's a cultural mistrust of therapists or any form of mental health services. Some people believe seeking help as a weakness or embarrassing. For low income families, these services aren't affordable or deemed as necessary. Regardless of the reason, we want to provide an open but anonymous free platform for individuals to seek guidance or just want to discuss a topic they can't have with someone they know.</h2>
